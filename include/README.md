# About

This directory contains all the public headers of the project.
In other words, these header files will define the API of the library.

Since the headers here are the only public facing part of the project,
it serves to doxygen document only the files in this directory.
The rest of the project can use internal/programmatic documentation,
like source code comments and tests.
