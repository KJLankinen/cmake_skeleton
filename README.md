# About

This is a skeleton for a CMake project.

How to use this?
1. Clone this repository to your machine
2. Navigate to a directory where you want to setup the new project e.g. `~/Projects`
3. Execute `/path/to/this/dir/scripts/setup_new_project.sh name_of_new_project`

The script above will clone this repository locally, substitus some names with
the given project name, remove some files and add some helpful advice to `README.md`.

If you end up using this often, you may want to make a symbolic link to the script
in a directory that's in your path.
